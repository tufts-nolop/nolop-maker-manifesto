The deal with bolts
There are two major families of bolts: imperial and metric. (There are a
couple others-- acme threads and Whitworth threads, but they are rare.
In modern America, you only find Whitworth threads on old door knobs.
Acme threads are found on large threaded rods used in clamps, vises, and
lead screws.)
Every bolt has three important characteris cs: diameter, thread pitch, and
length. Bolt length is measured from directly under the head of the bolt
to the p of the bolt; the thickness of the head is ignored (unless the bolt
is a flathead).
Imperial bolts come in two classes: coarse pitch and fine pitch. In general,
if you’re not sure which to pick, pick coarse. Fine threads are more easily
crushed, jammed with dirt, or cross-threaded. Imperial bolts are num-
bered with even numbers, 0-10. There also exist #1, #3, #5, and #12 bolts,
but nobody uses them, and you shouldn’t either. Let them die.
The first number, before the hyphen, indicates the diameter of the bolt;
the second number gives you the number of threads per inch.

A couple of notes:
1. Yes, #6 and #8 both have 32 threads per inch.
2. A er #10, the bolt diameters switch to frac onal inches; these values
are equal to the diameter of the outside of the threads.
